//To overcome this restriction, CORS allows servers to specify which origins are allowed to make requests to their resources. This is done by including specific headers in the server's response.

This is a security restriction to prevent malicious scripts from making unauthorized requests on behalf of the user.

//A cookie parser is a middleware function that parses cookies sent in the request headers and makes them available as an object in the request object.

//Node.js is not a framework, but rather a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server-side.
