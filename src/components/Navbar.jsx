/* React redux is a library that relies on single immutable object to store all the data*/
// if we want to change the state like when a button is clicked then new object is made that contains the current state and the action payload into a reducer function that returns a new object, therefore we can move back and forth between states
// first we install the redux toolkit  "npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux"
// redux is one single piece of store where all states are stored , if we update anything in redux store then it gets updated elsewhere also
// the components do not interact with each other but they are in direct contact with the redux store, this way we avoid prop drilling
// a state is generally for only one component and we can read the state of only that component exceot for when we do prop drilling
// reducer is a function that helps us in changing the state , takes previous state and action
